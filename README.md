### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing and securing network traffic accross distributed linux clusters presents significant challenges, including limited scalability, lack of real time monitoring, and absence of dynamic rule enforcement mechanisms. Existing solutions often fail to effectively handle large scale environements or provide centralized control for managing IPTable rules. This project aims to overcome these limitations by utilizing eBPF for kernel level packet inspection, realtime traffic analysis, and centralized rule enforcement, ensuring enhanced network security and operational efficiency.
