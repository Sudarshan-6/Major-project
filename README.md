### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing and securing network traffic accross distributed linux clusters presents significant challenges, including limited scalability, lack of real time monitoring, and absence of dynamic rule enforcement mechanisms. Existing solutions often fail to effectively handle large scale environements or provide centralized control for managing IPTable rules. This project aims to overcome these limitations by utilizing eBPF for kernel level packet inspection, realtime traffic analysis, and centralized rule enforcement, ensuring enhanced network security and operational efficiency.

### Data to be collected
Your project goal is to leverage eBPF for real-time packet inspection, traffic analysis, and centralized rule enforcement for better security and operational efficiency in distributed Linux clusters. The data you provided already covers several important aspects such as CPU usage, memory, disk space, bandwidth, DNS queries, firewall rules, HTTP requests, jitter, latency, and outbound traffic, which are all crucial for network monitoring and security analysis.

However, to fully address the challenges in your problem statement—such as scalability, real-time monitoring, and dynamic rule enforcement—there are a few additional data points you might want to consider collecting to enhance the overall visibility and control over the network traffic across the clusters:

### 1. **Network Traffic Data:**
   - **Packet Counts per Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.):** Track the number of packets per protocol to identify if there are unusual patterns in the types of traffic.
   - **Packets per Interface (eth0, etc.):** Monitor traffic across different network interfaces to understand how network load is distributed.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "Network Traffic": {
     "eth0": {
       "TCP": 1200,
       "UDP": 150,
       "ICMP": 50
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** Helps monitor traffic distribution by protocol and identify potential network issues (e.g., high TCP traffic or unusual ICMP activity).

### 2. **IP Traffic Distribution:**
   - **Traffic Distribution per IP:** While you are already collecting data on bandwidth usage, it would help to also have a broader traffic distribution per IP or subnet to identify top talkers (IP addresses with the most traffic) and potential issues with rogue IPs.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "IP Traffic Distribution": {
     "192.168.1.100": {
       "sent": 5000,
       "received": 7000
     },
     "192.168.1.101": {
       "sent": 3000,
       "received": 4000
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** Identifies which IPs are generating the most traffic, both inbound and outbound, which is important for detecting DDoS attacks or unauthorized access.

### 3. **Connection States:**
   - **Connection Tracking (e.g., SYN, ESTABLISHED):** Track the state of TCP connections (SYN, ESTABLISHED, FIN_WAIT, etc.) to identify potential issues with long-lived or unusual connections that might signify attacks like SYN flooding or port scanning.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "Connection States": {
     "SYN": 50,
     "ESTABLISHED": 200,
     "FIN_WAIT": 10
   }
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** Helps detect connection anomalies, such as excessive connections in the SYN state, indicating possible SYN flood attacks.

### 4. **Intrusion Detection Data:**
   - **Suspicious or Malicious Traffic:** Use eBPF programs to identify potentially malicious traffic (e.g., unusual patterns of failed login attempts, port scanning, etc.). You might want to track metrics like:
     - Failed login attempts (SSH, RDP, etc.)
     - Rate of invalid packets or connections from the same IP address (indicative of brute force attempts)
     - Port scans or unusual traffic spikes

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "Suspicious Traffic": {
     "failed_login_attempts": 15,
     "port_scans": 5
   }
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** These metrics can alert you to security breaches or attempted intrusions in real time.

### 5. **Flow Data:**
   - **Flow Data (NetFlow/sFlow/Flow Exporter):** Capture network flow data, including source/destination IPs, protocols, port numbers, and flow duration, to track and analyze network traffic patterns more deeply.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "Flows": [
     {
       "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
       "dest_ip": "192.168.1.200",
       "protocol": "TCP",
       "src_port": 80,
       "dest_port": 8080,
       "bytes": 5000
     }
   ]
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** Flow data provides a richer view of network communication, enabling the detection of anomalous behavior, such as traffic routing anomalies or suspicious service communications.

### 6. **Network Interface Utilization (Bandwidth per Interface):**
   - **Interface Utilization:** Track bandwidth usage across different network interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0) to understand network saturation and bottlenecks.

   **Example:**
   ```json
   "Interface Utilization": {
     "eth0": {
       "in_bytes": 1000000,
       "out_bytes": 500000
     },
     "wlan0": {
       "in_bytes": 2000000,
       "out_bytes": 1000000
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** Helps monitor how traffic is distributed between network interfaces, and identify underutilized or overutilized interfaces.

### 7. **Security Alerts and Event Logging:**
   - **Security Events and Alerts:** Collect and monitor logs for specific security events such as failed logins, firewall rule violations, or unauthorized access attempts.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     "Security Alerts": {
       "failed_login": 3,
       "unauthorized_access": 1
     }
     ```

   - **Interpretation:** This allows you to track incidents in real-time and take immediate action when necessary.

### Summary of Additional Data to Collect:
1. **Network Traffic by Protocol** (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
2. **Traffic Distribution per IP or Subnet**
3. **Connection States (SYN, ESTABLISHED, etc.)**
4. **Intrusion Detection Metrics** (Failed login attempts, port scans, brute force attempts)
5. **Flow Data** (NetFlow, sFlow, etc.)
6. **Network Interface Utilization** (inbound/outbound bandwidth per interface)
7. **Security Events and Alerts** (failed logins, unauthorized access attempts)

### Conclusion:
The data you have already outlined (CPU usage, memory, disk usage, etc.) is foundational and will help in monitoring system performance. However, to truly address the problem of network security and real-time traffic analysis across distributed Linux clusters, you will need additional data focused on network traffic, connection states, security events, and flow data. This will allow you to more effectively track, monitor, and respond to security incidents and network performance issues in real-time.
